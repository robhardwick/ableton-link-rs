/// # Represents a participant in a Link session.
/// 
/// Each Link instance has its own session state which
/// represents a beat timeline and a transport start/stop state. The
/// timeline starts running from beat 0 at the initial tempo when
/// constructed. The timeline always advances at a speed defined by
/// its current tempo, even if transport is stopped. Synchronizing to the
/// transport start/stop state of Link is optional for every peer.
/// The transport start/stop state is only shared with other peers when
/// start/stop synchronization is enabled.
/// 
/// A Link instance is initially disabled after construction, which
/// means that it will not communicate on the network. Once enabled,
/// a Link instance initiates network communication in an effort to
/// discover other peers. When peers are discovered, they immediately
/// become part of a shared Link session.
/// 
/// Each method of the Link type documents its thread-safety and
/// realtime-safety properties. When a method is marked thread-safe,
/// it means it is safe to call from multiple threads
/// concurrently. When a method is marked realtime-safe, it means that
/// it does not block and is appropriate for use in the thread that
/// performs audio IO.
/// 
/// Link provides one session state capture/commit method pair for use
/// in the audio thread and one for all other application contexts. In
/// general, modifying the session state should be done in the audio
/// thread for the most accurate timing results. The ability to modify
/// the session state from application threads should only be used in
/// cases where an application's audio thread is not actively running
/// or if it doesn't generate audio at all. Modifying the Link session
/// state from both the audio thread and an application thread
/// concurrently is not advised and will potentially lead to unexpected
/// behavior.
